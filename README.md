# p2pNoneCustodial

Non-custodial Peer to Peer Trading ☁️ ⚡😶‍🌫️

I couldn't find a way to lend people Bitcoin in a peep to peer and non-custodial manner so I created an application utilizing the Bitcoin Lightning Network for people to do just that! People are able to buy and sell Bitcoin peep to peer without their funds being in custody of anyone else. I also built a public API for developers to use. I engineered this application using React, Rest API, LND, Javascript, Go, and GRPC.

Server code moving here soon: https://github.com/suhailsaqan/rapit-backend
